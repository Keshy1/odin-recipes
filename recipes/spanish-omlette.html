        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This will be the easiest spanish omlette you'll ever prepare.
            The ingredients are simple and are very readily available in your supermarket or farmer's market near you.</p>
            <p><strong>The Spanish Paprika</strong> is the star of the show. It gives just the right amount of heat and smokiness to the omlette.
                If you're not a fan of heat you can reduce the amount of spanish paprika you put in but do not completly omit it. You'll thank me later.:-) </p>
