        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This recipe will give you the most fluffy pancakes you could ever dream off.
            They are airy on the inside and have just enough crunch on the outside</p>
        <p><strong>The Buttermilk</strong> is the star ingredient in this recipe.You could substitute it with milk or even water but I would highly suggest you use the butter milk.
            They are so fluffy you dont even need to use <em>maple syrup</em> or any other kind of <em>syrup</em>,feel free to use some,just know its optional.</p>
